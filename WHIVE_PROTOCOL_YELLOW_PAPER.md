***1.About***

Whive, is a blockchain protocol that extends the Bitcoin Blockchain through enabling _Trustless Rewards for Engineering Sustainable Solutions._

Building on the success of Bitcoin the World&#39;s most secure blockchain, the Whive community has set out to build a cryptographically secure blockchain protocol and Auxiliary Chain(AuxChain) that will allow for building applications that trustlessly reward sustainable solutions.

The Whive Protocol is built with game-theory that rewards machines operating in regions in the World with high solar reliability!

Thus, the protocol will incentivize engineers in the developing World to contribute to developing sustainable solutions to challenges facing their community using the following Engineering disciplines:

- Network Engineering
- Software Engineering
- Protocol Engineering

The Whive protocol will be supported by a suite of software tools built to incentivize multiple third-party individuals and institutions to collaborate together to execute and achieve this vision.

The Whive protocol is designed to unlock the potential of sustainable resources such as Solar Energy by enabling a distributed economy that is interoperable with the mainstream economy.

The background for this project is from a published research paper report by BitHub Africa the Founding contributor to the Whive protocol titled &quot;The African Blockchain Opportunity&quot;, 2017.

The Whive Protocol is being built, tested and deployed by a community of individuals and organizations around the World.



***2. Current Specifications***

The Whive protocol contains the following specifications:

- It is a Bitcoin Fork and Auxiliary Chain, shall utilize the Bitcoin code base to remain compatible with Bitcoin.
- The protocol shall have its Rewards generated through a hybrid Proof-of-Work and Proof-Of-Stake algorithm.
- The Reward symbol which is also the name of the wallet is WHIVE.
- The smallest unit of the Reward will be 0.00000001 WHIVE.
- There shall be a maximum supply of 100,000,000 Rewards over a period of ~20 years(by 2040). With ~18,550,000 of the total rewards being claimed by Bitcoiners from a snapshot of Bitcoins UTXO&#39;s.
- Distribution of the remaining Rewards shall be through a Split Rewards algorithm, where 70% go to CPU mining nodes and another 30% to staking nodes.
- The algorithm checks the type of processor and timezone of all nodes attributing a higher weight to nodes with higher daylight threshold and desired CPU optimizations.
- The algorithm sets aside a 30% percent stake for validators on the network supporting staking nodes.
- The protocol shall support between 7 - 20 transactions per second on a 1 - 2 MB blocksize or a Segregated Witness (SegWit) enabled block-weight of 4 MB similar to Bitcoin.
- The protocol shall adopt the latest Bitcoin source code which notably includes Segwit enabled transactions and different wallet schemes.
- The protocol will support Layer 2 Protocols such as lightning to enable fast and micro-transactions on the Bitcoin network to ensure atomic-swap capabilities.

***3. RoadMap***

Research and Development of the The Whive protocol began in 2017 with the following roadmap:

- **Q2-2017,  Research &amp; Analysis:** We identified a key problem area within the developing countries of lack of way to incentivize engineering of sustainable solutions. Such as  lack of access to energy is a key problem facing most communities in this region.

- **Q3-2018, Testing GPU &amp; CPU Algorithms(Lyra, Argon and Yespower):** We tested multiple algorithms to determine which are most suitable for the tokenization of Solar Energy capture. We found YesPower to be the most adaptable an easy to secure.
- **Q1-2019, Forking Bitcoin Code:** We forked Bitcoin Code as it has most  of the functionality we need for implementing the protocol. We are tweaking the Proof-Of-Work and adding a Proof-of-Stake mechanism to reward engineers across our target markets.
- **Q2-2019, Yespower Implementation:**  We adopted YesPower 1.0 to allow only CPU and GPU machines to be rewarded by the Protocol. We want to restrict ASIC based machines from getting these rewards.
- **Q2-2019, Private Testnet:**  We launched the Private Testnet for internal testing of the protocol.
- **Q3-2019, DNSSeeder setup /Nodes Setups:  ** We have setup the seeder to allow the Whive Network to be visible on the network.
- **Q4-2019, Yespower Time &amp; Machine optimization:** We are adding Machine, Time-Zone and Processor optimization to the Yespower Implementation.
- **Q1-2020, Public Testnet:**  We will allow the public to test our network before launch.
- **Q1-2020, Community Launch Mainnet :**  The Whive Network should go live on 02/02/2020 together with the Yellow Paper for community audit and peer review.
- **Q2-2020, Mining pool & Mining software:** We will publish documentation for third-party pools for mining and staking operations.
- **Q2-2020, Protocol Upgrades:** Protocol features will be updated by Community Contributors with a Version 2 software release which includes increased Optimization of the Yespower algorithm, a Bitcoin UTXOs hard fork, and release of wallet for claiming Whive Rewards by Bitcoiners.
- **Q2-2020, Exchange Listing:** Community exchange listing requests can begin after the hard fork.
- **Q3-2020, Protocol Upgrades:** Protocol features will be updated by Community Contributors with a Version 3 software release which includes a hard fork, Proof-of-Stake, Split Rewards, and Green Paper publication with peer-reviewed mathematical proofs.
- **Q4-2020, Protocol Up-scaling:**  Launch of a new Roadmap  for code cleanup and re-factoring, SDK Release and Copay Mobile Wallet for Android and IPhones.

***4. Governance***

The Whive protocol is governed as a Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO). Network participants can make contributions as developers, miners, testers, trainers and users independently. Code audit and contributions shall be made via our main github repository located at[https://github.com/whiveio](https://github.com/whiveio).

The Whive protocol development and test-net deployment and has been funded  by BitHub Africa a leading Blockchain Accelerator operating across Africa.

Subsequently, should the network accrue enough value; the Whive protocol will be governed by a community funded Foundation known as the **Whive Foundation** which will be registered in a Blockchain friendly jurisdiction no later than 18 months after accruing the required economic value to setup the Foundation.

The main goal for the Foundation is to manage the claiming of WHIVE Rewards allocated to the Bitcoin Network. Additionally, the Foundation will facilitate meetups and engagements with third parties including analysts, developers and other contributors.

The Foundation will not have any control of the protocol beyond organizing the aforementioned functions.

The Whive project has a 7 year plan to achieve ubiquity for solving its key challenges.

As such the Whive Foundation shall have a bounty program that will be used to ensure that yearly milestones are met within the planned time-frame of the project.

The Foundation will be funded by unclaimed WHIVE Rewards after the end of the snapshot period described in the Roadmap.

**Over a 7 year period from main-net launch the funds will be allocated as follows:**

1. 30% towards operations and maintenance of Foundation in a Legal Jurisdiction
2. 30% for the Founders of the protocol
3. 30% for Founding Contributors which includes the project  Advisors
4. 10% towards the Community Faucet

The Whive Community (of users) is entitled to responsibly mine, stake, and trade their own Rewards.

The Whive Community is governed by the Whive Code of Conduct.
